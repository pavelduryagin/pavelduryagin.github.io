<p>Hello, my name is <b>Pavel Duryagin</b>, and welcome to my personal website. Here you can find detailed information about my research interests, publications, and ongoing projects.</p>

<p>I am a linguist currently working as a postdoctoral researcher at <a href="https://www.unive.it/pag/13526" target=”_blank”>Ca' Foscari University of Venice</a> in Italy. 
    My primary scientific interests lie in the fields of phonetics and phonology. One of my key areas of interest is second language acquisition and heritage languages. 
    While my research predominantly focuses on the prosody of Standard and non-Standard Russian, I am enthusiastic about collaborating on studies 
    involving other languages, including Italian, and their dialects. 
    </p>

<p>At Ca' Foscary University, I teach courses in Russian linguistics and Russian language to both undergraduate (BA) and graduate (MA) students. 
    Additionally, I supervise theses in the areas of phonetics and phonology.
    I am a member of the <a href="https://www.unive.it/pag/40828/" target=”_blank”>Bembolab Laboratory</a> Board of Directors. Bembolab is an interdisciplinary laboratory within the Department of
    Linguistics and Comparative Cultural Studies.</p>

<p> Please do not hesitate to email me at <a href="mailto:pavel.duryagin@unive.it">pavel.duryagin@unive.it</a> in case you have questions.</p>

<p>Thank you for visiting!</p>
